/*69 Implement int sqrt(int x). Compute and return the square root of x, where
x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer. Since the return type is an
integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the
result is returned.
Input: 4		Output: 2
Input: 8		Output: 2
The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2
is returned																	 */
